I am tired of opening several websites, logging in and looking at my domains / hosting plans / VMs and watching their expiration every once in a while.
I want to put API keys and click "Fetch" and it will fetch all my domains, hosting plans, VMs, and other hosting entities from all providers I work with, along with their expiration.
This is WIP. For now I support only Hostinger and domains.

Future plans:
1. Add GoDaddy.
2. Pull hosting plans.
3. Pull VMs.
4. Add cache for API keys instead of inputting them every time.
